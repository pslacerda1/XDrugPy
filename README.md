This is a PyMOL based graphical tool for early steps in the drug discovery chain. Novel FTMap and AutoDock Vina analyses are made possible and intuitive. Leverage the power of these softwares with ease.

XDrugPy enables FTMap hotspot identification, calculates ligand fit to hotspots, counts probes next to residue and clusters hotspots by its properties.

XDrugPy also enables docking and virtual screening using the AutoDock Vina, identifies important residues, visualizes and clusters ligands binding mode interactions.
