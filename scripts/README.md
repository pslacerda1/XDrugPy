Welcome to the XDrugPy/scripts directory

1. If you don't have a functional plugin yet, first follow the install steps from https://tiny.cc/XDrugPy to get a working plugin.
2. Then run the next command into the PyMOL's console to also install XDrugPy like a Python package.

        pip install -U https://github.com/pslacerda1/XDrugPy/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

3. Copy the script you want to a folder you own and edit it to your needs then open the terminal or PyMOL's console, navigate to there and run it like:
   
        pymol -c hca.py

Be aware to be on the right console. If you are at Windows, it looks like the Cmd black screen.

Ensure you're using a sane text editor (like Notepad++ or VSCode) to edit the scripts.
